    <h1 style="margin-top:0">About</h1>
    <p>
  <b>C-SPADE</b> web-application serves as an interactive and innovative visualization tool for drug screening data. It reterives compounds structural information and clusters them based on their structural similarties, which is later visualized as a dendrogram of compounds augmented with their bioactivity values and other compound annotations. Additionally, it allows a real-time comparison of investigational compounds against a screening panel for drug development or repurposing applications. C-SPADE deals with various types of drug screening assays (biochemical, cell-based, cell-free). Tailored to be accessible to researchers with little to no chemoinformatics skills, it requires only the raw drug screening data as input and automatically calculates the structural information required for compound clustering, thereby significantly reducing the manual time required for such analysis.

  C-SPADE web application creates compound based similarity dendrogram designed for drug screening data. C-SPADE has not been designed for high throughput studies hence though very large compound trees can be visualized it is time consuming and memory intensive. C-SPADE has been checked for compatibility with standard modern browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Google chrome and Safari). Certain features of C-SPADE requires browser cookies hence make sure that browser privacy settings allow cookies to be stored.

                  On clicking the <i>Data Preview icon</i> in the upload page the user is redirected to the <i>Data Preview</i> page. Here the user’s input data are displayed in a tabular format augmented with two other columns, PubChem CID, the compound ID from PubChem database, SMILES the input or retrieved structural information of the compound. This page allows the users to manually edit, curate, filter and sort the data. The PubChem CID column contains the compound ID’s as hyperlinks to the PubChem database. Right-Clicking on the CID redirects the user to the PubChem Database with the compound information. Since C-SPADE relies on PubChem database for retrieving SMILES description, there can be cases where C-SPADE fails to return the SMILES. In such scenarios, the user is expected to provide SMILES of the compound for it to be included in the visualization. By default, all the columns with SMILES information will be selected, but the user can also select a subset of compounds for visualization (<i>a minimum of 10 compounds are necessary to generate the dendrogram</i>) through the select icon given in the far-left corner of the table.


</p>

                 <p>Prior to visualization, the user should specify the type of activity measure (DSS, AUC IC50, EC50, Ki or Kd) that was used in the screening process, the default activity measure is <b>DSS</b>. These parameters along with the column names of the bioactivity values will be used as legends in the visualization workspace. The order in which the assay information are provided in the input data will be the order by which they are represented.
